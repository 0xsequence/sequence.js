# Network Names

Though networks have proper full names, we sometimes need to refer to a chain by a name slug.

A name slug is the name, sometimes simplified, and in kebab-case. This maximizes compatibility in the event that you want to use chain names as url paths, or filenames.

You can use this file as a reference to look up the correct network name slug a network's full name or its chain ID.
